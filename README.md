I have a long time develop backend application based on Play Framework. 
Last year I change my job, So I come back to use Spring Framework for some projects in my company. 
Spring Framework has come a long way, with more features, more tools .etc

### Development

I added spring-boot-devtools to Automatic Restart. Applications that use spring-boot-devtools automatically restart whenever files on the classpath change.  
This project use IntelliJ IDEA IDE 2019.3. So, when you build the project (Build +→+ Build Project) will triggers a event restart.
